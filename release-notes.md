This file is pre-generated via *GitHub Actions* during package creation based on the 
contents of `CHANGELOG.md`. It should then contain the changes associated with the latest 
version of the package or release.

The content is then used both as PackageReleaseNotes and as the notes-file for the 
release on GitHub.

The file must exist so that the build process does not fail.
